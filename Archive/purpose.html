        <h1>SoMe purpose</h1>
        <p>Our SoMe project is focusing on helping future and current international 
            students. Moving to Denmark and generally abroad may be difficult, therefore, 
            we are creating this project to get the users to their goals, potentially fill out the application for BAAA.</p>

        <div class="question1">
        <h2>What do we want to achieve with our presence on SoMe?</h2>
        <p>Future inspiration for future/ current international students, 
            ease the anxiety and doubts regarding long-distance moving abroad; 
            secondary to promote BAAA. <br>
            We want to help future students improve their quality of life by 
            interacting with our WebDoc project, to reclaim the confidence and
             motivation to have the courage to step forward and stand behind their
              choices 100% <br>
              Help BAAA amplify their education opportunities for the future students
               and integrate them in the DK environment. Help them be successful. </p>

            <h2>Which stories do we want to tell and HOW can we make them relevant for the SoMe users?</h2>
            <p>Vulnerable and very human site. Professional ( schools, tasks, maybe job...) as well but showing 
            Lukas as an ordinarily relatable person who continues on his student journey in DK, gaining new
            peculiar experience to share with users

        <div class="question3">
            <h2>Which types of users we do we have and what type of content they are likely interact with/ react to?</h2>
            <p>Surveys - Young international teen( future) students from 18 - 23 form 31,6%, Young adults ( from 24 - 29 yrs) international students ( 63,2%)
             <br>Interviews - nationality of majority from central-east EU. All of them are eager and motivated to change their life, but also hesitant because of the importance and seriousness of big steps, adventurous.
